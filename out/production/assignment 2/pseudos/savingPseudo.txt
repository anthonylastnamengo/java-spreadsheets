User is using a file.
User wants to save the file.

User selects Save File option:
    FileSaving.java takes in a sheet instance (the sheet currently working on)
    Constructor stores the sheet

    program prompts for user to input a file destination:
        user inputs file destination -> store in variable Optional<String> filePath //

    if filePath null or invalid:
        prompt.message -> invalid file because + whatever
        return

    otherwise:
    pass file path to FileWriter(filePath) in the save(filePath) method.
    BufferedWriter will write to a .txt file:
        the sheet will be taken as input to a method: sheet.encode()


Steps -> Implement:
    Prompting an ask when feature is clicked
    Storing file path provided as an Optional??
    Checking if file path is valid or invalid
